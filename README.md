## ASIC Implementation of a Serial-Parallel Multiplier

This project demonstrates a complete **RTL-to-GDSII** flow for a custom 32-bit Serial-Parallel Multiplier (SPM) using the open-source [OpenLane2](https://github.com/efabless/openlane2) ASIC toolchain and the [Google-Skywater SKY130](https://skywater-pdk.readthedocs.io/) process node.

The implementation was performed on **Google Colab**, proving the feasibility of cloud-based ASIC design with open-source tools.

## üßÆ Architecture Overview

The multiplier is architected for area efficiency, using a bit-serial approach. The core consists of:
*   **Carry-Save Adders (CSAs):** Chained together to form the multiplication array, minimizing propagation delay.
*   **Terminal Cell (TCMP):** A custom-designed cell to handle the sign extension and final accumulation for the most significant bit.
*   **Pipelining:** All state elements are clocked, making the design synchronous.



## ‚öôÔ∏è Toolflow & Implementation

The design was processed through the following steps in the OpenLane2 flow:

1.  **Synthesis:** Using `Yosys` to translate RTL to a gate-level netlist with `sky130` standard cells.
2.  **Floorplanning:** Defining the chip core and die area.
3.  **Placement:**
    *   **Global Placement:** Creating an optimal but illegal placement.
    *   **Detailed Placement:** Legalizing the placement onto the standard cell grid.
4.  **Clock Tree Synthesis (CTS):** Building a balanced clock tree to minimize skew.
5.  **Routing:**
    *   **Global Routing:** Planning the route guides for all nets.
    *   **Detailed Routing:** Implementing the physical wiring using `TritonRoute`.
6.  **Signoff:**
    *   **DRC:** Design Rule Checking with `Magic`.
    *   **LVS:** Layout vs. Schematic checking with `Netgen`.



## üöÄ How to Replicate

The flow was designed for Google Colab. You can find the complete notebook and instructions for running it here:

### Prerequisites
*   A Google account to access Colab.
*   Basic understanding of Verilog and ASIC design flow.

### Running the Flow
1.  Open the provided Colab notebook.
2.  Follow the cells sequentially to install OpenLane, run the flow, and view results.
3.  The final GDS and reports will be generated in the Colab runtime.
