# sky130-serial-parallel-multiplier
Executed a complete RTL-to-GDSII flow to harden a custom-designed 32-bit serial-parallel multiplier (SPM) using open-source EDA tools.The project was implemented on Google Colab, showcasing ability to leverage cloud resources for complex ASIC design tasks.The final layout was verified for manufacturability and correctness against the original RTL.
